# LambdaClass Hobby Club - Hacking Learning Path Handbook

## Home

Welcome! This is a guide intended to aid employees in their first days in the company.

## Disclaimer

At Lambda We won't micromanage you because we don't want to: **we give flexibility but ask for responsibility in exchange**.
Of course you can have days off to study or if you feel sick, but you can also have days off if you feel brain fog, nervous or a bit under the weather; we actually prefer it that way.

If you feel healthy and are comfortable, you will be able to solve more efficiently the problems you have in front of you. And even better, you will contribute to a healthier workspace.

Nobody wants to give up, that's a common emotion. The good news is that you are not giving up, you are getting to know yourself better, so you can recharge energies and keep learning and improving. In turn, when you are working we expect you to hit goals, be proactive and be a valuable member of the team.

There are three key elements we want you to have present at every moment: *Communication, Accountability and Empathy*.

- **Communication** is a key aspect for every human relationship. If you can measure your words to give a positive clear message, you can achieve anything in life through teamwork. Try labeling your emotions before communicating, since it is likely that people in front of you do not know what is going through your head. Also, be transparent but assertive if you disagree about something, it will help understand your point of view. Finally, try to avoid direct messages, working on channels allows more people to be on the loop and better feedback can be given.
- **Accountability**. Everyone makes mistakes, learners do something about them. If you get something wrong, communicate poorly or even feel overwhelmed about a situation, raise your hand and say it. It's very likely that a process failed, not you. Many people will be there to help you sort the issue, and you will surely learn something along the way. If you keep quiet and don't say anything you will regret it later when the truth burst through another hole.
- About **empathy**, we are all human beings and have complex emotions, if you are feeling great, it doesn't mean your colleague isn't feeling like shit. Perhaps your coworkers don't feel comfortable talking about emotions, so go talk with them and help them. You can talk to them or to their manager if you feel something is going on with them. There is a time when everybody feels weak and needs someone else for support. So be a hero, be empathic.

If you are reading this, you are probably giving your first -or second- steps on the long journey towards being a good developer, but first try to be a good human being and you will see how far that can get you.

## Company Culture

### Principles for success and teamwork philosophy

We follow a code of conduct that must be followed to ensure a safe space in the team. You signed it when you entered Lambda and we expect you to follow it. Basically, treat everyone with respect.

- [Learning Rust](https://learning-rust.github.io/)

## Development Workflow

### Getting started

- Two-step authentication is mandatory for every login of the company accounts (e.g. Slack, mail, GitHub).
- Also, the company's GitHub repositories are [accessed via SSH](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh)

### GitHub & GitLab

- If you are new to GitHub, you can put your hands on with [this course](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/introduction-to-github)
- Progress in any project must be pushed every day. This must be done within a branch of the master repository and a Pull Request (PR) must be opened for reviewing the code, previous to merging the branch to master.
- Never push to master directly, and only reviewers can merge branches to master.

### Working method

- There is a weekly call with every member of the team to set the most important goals of the week, as well as a daily call to focus on the problems of the daily tasks.
- When working on projects, the specific tasks to tackle are written in clickup.

### Design and coding standards

- Suggested reading: [Coders at work](https://www.amazon.com/Coders-Work-Reflections-Craft-Programming/dp/1430219483)
- [make is the build tool](https://medium.com/@jlouis666/how-to-build-stable-systems-6fe9dcf32fc4#e398). Consider [these notes](http://gromnitsky.users.sourceforge.net/articles/notes-for-new-make-users/).
- Postgresql is the default database.
- Write tests.
- Favor integration tests over unit tests, but do write unit tests when the functions merit them.
- Do not write tests before you have solved the problem, you may waste time writing tests for the wrong implementation.
- Start with [the simplest thing that could possibly work](http://www.artima.com/intv/simplest3.html).
- Don't try to foresee future uses of your program: [You aren't gonna need it](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/Yagni.html).
- Write for humans: coding for computers is easy, but writing code that is understandable by another person is an art.
- Code and document in english, unless you have a very specific reason no to.
- Use meaningful, readable names for variables, functions and files. Don't try to save characters.
- Documentation is a sign of the quality of an API. It's easier to write it when the design is right.
- The less code you have the better. Deleted code is debugged code.
- Aim for simplicity, not performance. The latter is a by-product of the first.
- Only introduce optimizations if you have benchmarks that proof an improvement and that the improvement is relevant in the context of the program.
- Only introduce optimizations if they represent a concrete gain (e.g. cost savings, improved user experience).
- Follow the [Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/), regardless of the language you are using at the moment. English also counts as a language.
- Don't introduce dependencies prematurely. You must evaluate your requirements, maintenance and integration costs first.
- If you want to upgrade a dependency, test it first.
- Always lock your dependencies. Pin a specific version and a commit of a dependency, don't use the version at master.
Use git and commit often, even in one-person projects.

### Open source projects

- Suggested reading: [The Architecture of Open Source Applications](http://aosabook.org/en/index.html).
- Use MIT license.
- Fill the description field at the top of the repo page.
- Write a decent README.
- A good readme starts with a succint description (one or two sentences) and, when possible, a very short and illustrative example use. The rest of the details go after this header.
- Use continuous integration, most likely travis.org.
- Make a good balance of features vs maintenance. Maintenance details usually matter more than adding a lot of features.

### Community projects

We organize activities where we share thoughts and interests with anyone who want to join us.

- [BuzzConf](https://buzzconf.org/) A conference for developers, by developers. Past talks [here](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCE6_WdRbp8pN2IPNwXcu9Ww/videos).
- [Zruput](https://zruput.org/) Digital Communications Conference.
- [This is not a monad tutorial](https://notamonadtutorial.com/) Writings, reviews and interviews about programming.
- [Papers We Love Buenos Aires](https://github.com/papers-we-love/buenos-aires) Once a month we organize a meeting where we discuss scientific papers we love. Join us on [Telegram](https://t.me/pwlba).

## Python

- [The Zen of Python](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/) is your bible.
- Use Python 3 in greenfield projects.
- Strive to migrate to Python 3 in non greenfield projects.
- Read [this](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41573587/what-is-the-difference-between-venv-pyvenv-pyenv-virtualenv-virtualenvwrappe/41573588#41573588) to understand environment hell in Python.
- Use [pipenv](https://github.com/pypa/pipenv) to escape from environment hell in Python. You can even do this locally in projects that are set up to use virtualenv and virtualenvwrapper.
- If you also need to stick with a specific minor version of Python (e.g. Python 2.7.14) you can use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) in combination with pipenv.

## Julia

- [Julia Koans](https://github.com/lambdaclass/julia_koans) that will give you some short but effective understanding.
- [Julia Academy](https://juliaacademy.com/) for getting your hands dirty with some great tutorials.

## Erlang & Elixir

- Read the book [Learn you some Erlang for great good!](https://learnyousomeerlang.com/content) if you want to learn some Erlang.
- Use rebar3. Include the binary in the repository so it's not an external dependency and the tested version is used. rebar3 is not used directly but through make targets.
- Support the most recent Erlang version.
- When building libraries, try to make them both easily usable from the shell and easily configurable via application environment.
- Indent with two spaces.
- Avoid using header files (.hrl) [TODO ELABORATE].
- Supervised processes provide guarantees in their initialization phase, not a best effort. [If you expect failure to happen on an external service, do not make its presence a guarantee of your system](https://ferd.ca/it-s-about-the-guarantees.html).
- Try to avoid timer:sleep on tests, [ktn_task:wait_for_success](https://github.com/lambdaclass/erlang-katana/blob/master/src/ktn_task.erl#L28) can be a better option. More on this [here](https://medium.com/erlang-battleground/the-missing-testing-tip-628686ebbbda).
- Prefer maps to records.

# Reading code
